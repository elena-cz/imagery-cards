The lights make it hard to see the audience but you can see a large crowd clapping and cheering.    Images of your life appear on a screen behind you. You feel the unconditional love from the crowd as you see they understand what each challenge has taught you. Your hard times and your good times have brought you to this place right now. A wave of self-acceptance comes over you. Send back the same unconditional love to each member of your audience.`,

        Tie the card to a big balloon which is loosely tied to the table. When you are ready, release the balloon and watch it fly higher and higher until it has soared out of sight. Take a deep breath as it disappears and know that everything can be transformed for the better.`,

        Step into his arms and enjoy the best hug possible. Charlie’s hugs are strong and comforting. His light brown fur is flecked with gold and has a nice woodsy scent. You feel yourself melt—it feels good to get a hug like this! Maybe during the day, you will have the chance to return the favor to someone else!`,

Are there any sounds that you hear that lull you gently to sleep? 
        Go to bed in this most peaceful of places. Your eyes feel comfortably heavy and your breathing slows as you let your mind rest on a calming thought. Fall asleep easily and wake refreshed and energized.`,

This boat has a small moveable seat and two oars to help get you back to the dock but mostly it's made for drifting in the sunshine. It is lined with cushions and full of colorful pillows. An adjustable canopy allows for the perfect amount of shade.
        Hop in and get everything set just right. Push off from the dock and settle into the cushions. The light breeze gently pushes the boat. It rocks ever so slightly side to side, gently lulling you into a deep state of relaxation. You can hear the little ripples the boat is making. You feel as if you haven’t a care in the world...`,

You feel as if you are connected with everything you see, and for a while, even your body seems to blend in with your surroundings...`,

The book lays unread on your chest. Your hammock continues to rock...back and forth...lulling you into a deep state of relaxation. Your thoughts begin to drift…`,

//    You are surrounded by the finest minds possible. Ask questions and be open to hearing their advice. Consider everything they suggest and teach about any subject, then make up your own mind!

// Bowling Ball

// Can do!
//   You are at a bowling alley having fun with friends. Your bowling ball is special! It has the words “I CAN!” prominently painted on it. You look down the lane and see the pins have the words “I CAN’T” painted on them. If you care to, you can lift up your binoculars and see that each pin has a reason why you think you can’t painted in smaller letters. 
//   You pick up the ball and with perfect form, you release it and watch it glide down the lane. It blasts through the pins with a satisfying sound. Yes!! You pump your fist and enjoy the moment! You say to yourself, “I can!

You feel happy to be alive on a day like this. With each step, you feel lighter and lighter. Ahead you see a bridge.     Anticipation and excitement build within you as you approach the bridge. You can see that it crosses a wide and lovely river. As you begin crossing the bridge, you notice it was built with special attention. You wonder what is on the other side. Will it be even more beautiful?  What do you find as you reach the other side?
