    text: `You are at a performance when suddenly, during intermission, you are called up onto the stage. There is a special presentation tonight! The lights make it hard to see the audience but you can see a large crowd clapping and cheering.
      Images of your life appear on a screen behind you. You feel the unconditional love from the crowd as you see they understand what each challenge has taught you. Your hard times and your good times have brought you to this place right now. A wave of self-acceptance comes over you. Send back the same unconditional love to each member of your audience.`,

    subtitle: 'Let it go',
    text: `Is there something that you just can’t let go? Is it a person, a memory of an injustice? Now is the time to let it go. There is a small table in front of you with blank cards of paper. Write out whatever you know you need to let go of.
      Tie the card to a big balloon which is loosely tied to the table. When you are ready, release the balloon and watch it fly higher and higher until it has soared out of sight. Take a deep breath as it disappears and know that everything can be transformed for the better.`,

    text: `Anytime is the right time for the best hug of your life. Meet Charlie the Bear. He knows bears can be scary, but not him. He is clean and soft with no sharp claws. His brown eyes twinkle as he waits for you.
      Step into his arms and enjoy the best hug possible. Charlie’s hugs are strong and comforting. His light brown fur is flecked with gold and has a nice woodsy scent. You feel yourself melt—it feels good to get a hug like this! Maybe during the day, you will have the chance to return the favor to someone else!`,

Are there any sounds that you hear that lull you gently to sleep?
      Go to bed in this most peaceful of places. Your eyes feel comfortably heavy and your breathing slows as you let your mind rest on a calming thought. Fall asleep easily and wake refreshed and energized.`,

      What do the labels say? How balanced is your bike? Can you ride it easily? If necessary, adjust the contents of the containers so that everything is weighted just the way you like it! Now it’s easy to get on your bike and go for a ride. Return feeling well-balanced and content!`,

    text: `A private lake and a small boat is all the invitation you need to slip away for a few minutes. This boat has a small moveable seat and two oars to help get you back to the dock but mostly it's made for drifting in the sunshine. It is lined with cushions and full of colorful pillows. An adjustable canopy allows for the perfect amount of shade.
      Hop in and get everything set just right. Push off from the dock and settle into the cushions. The light breeze gently pushes the boat. It rocks ever so slightly side to side, gently lulling you into a deep state of relaxation. You can hear the little ripples the boat is making. You feel as if you haven’t a care in the world...`,

You sit comfortably upright with a clear view up and down the beach. The pink and blue colors seem to surround you. Out in front, waves are breaking in a steady rhythm. They make a soothing crashing sound.
      Crash…..crash.....crash… Another set rolls in. Crash…..crash…..crash... Your breathing becomes deeper and deeper as you watch the waves. You feel your awareness start to expand. You feel as if you are connected with everything you see, and for a while, even your body seems to blend in with your surroundings...`,

You shed some of your warmer clothing and make your way to the armchair near the fireplace. The air in the room is a bit chilly but you can feel the radiant heat coming from the fire and you know you will be warmed up soon.
      As you sink into your favorite chair, you feel the warmth on your feet, relaxing them. You feel the warmth on your legs, relaxing them. Your chest and arms relax as you let out a long exhale. The dancing flames are mesmerizing…you feel perfectly safe, perfectly relaxed, perfectly peaceful.`,

It’s warm, but there is a breeze coming off the ocean which keeps everything fresh. You bring some easy reading out to the beach and find a hammock set up in the shade. You brush the sand from your feet and make yourself comfortable in the hammock.
      You begin to sway back and forth…so gently. The sound of palm fronds rustling is a delight for your ears. As you watch them move in the breeze, your eyelids become heavy and start to close. The book lays unread on your chest. Your hammock continues to rock...back and forth...lulling you into a deep state of relaxation. Your thoughts begin to drift…`,

      You enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, birds making calls, flowers blooming. You feel happy to be alive on a day like this. With each step, you feel lighter and lighter. Ahead you see a bridge.
      Anticipation and excitement build within you as you approach the bridge. You can see that it crosses a wide and lovely river. As you begin crossing the bridge, you notice it was built with special attention. You wonder what is on the other side. Will it be even more beautiful? What do you find as you reach the other side?`,

You look down the lane and see the pins have the words “I CAN’T” painted on them. If you care to, you can lift up your binoculars and see that each pin has a reason why you think you can’t painted in smaller letters.
      You pick up the ball and with perfect form, you release it and watch it glide down the lane. It blasts through the pins with a satisfying sound. Yes!! You pump your fist and enjoy the moment! You say to yourself, “I can!`,
